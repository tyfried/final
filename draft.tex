\section{Introduction}

An interesting problem in coding theory is how to determine the maximum possible
number of codewords in a code.  For an $n$-dimensional code, we are interested in 
the maximum number of codewords such that the code has weight $d$.  
Formally, we use the notation $A_q(n,d)$
and $B_q(n,d)$, defined as the maximum of number of codewords in a code over
$\mathbb{F}_q$ of length $n$ and minimum distance $d$ for an arbitrary (linear
on non-linear) code and linear code, respectively.  It is not always possible to In lecture, we have
considered upper bounds---Sphere Packing, Singleton, and Greismer---as well as
lower bounds---Gilbert and Varshamov---on these values.  The purpose of this
paper is to consider other well-known bounds in the literature.

This paper is broken up into $x$ sections.

talk about importance
define it
prove it
work out some examples

talk about importance
define it
prove two lemmas that do the heavy lifting
easy proof to finish it off
work out some examples

Linear Programming Bound
